## Information

I've always liked math. When the computer science classes started at school, I liked solving problems in Pascal. I entered the university for the specialty Production Automation, which is related to programming.  
After graduating from university, I started working as a design engineer and moved away from programming.  
But I always liked to study, to learn new things. I started to study layout, JavaScript, jQuery on my own. I tried to write a website using Bootstrap. I would like to try myself as a Frontend developer or application developer. And I go to my goal.
